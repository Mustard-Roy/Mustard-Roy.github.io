        I started my concept by reflecting this year, this COVID year.<br><br>
As far as I know, the pandemic began from Wuhan, China. Then, it spread across China rapidly because of the Spring Festival Holiday that most of the people worked in another city got back to their hometown.Then, the coronavirus spread globally, from the East Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, to European countries , especially from Italy. Following, a large number of cases  imported from the Europe to America, who blocked traveling from China at the very beginning but left the door open to Europe. From this on, the COVID became a really global pandemic that nearly crashed most countries medical system. <br><br>
Since it became a global issue, many unfriendly and racist actions towards Asians revealed again to the public. <br><br>
A student from Singapore was beaten up in Oxford Street by a group of men who told him that they didn’t want his coronavirus in their country. 
Also, a lot of Anti-Asian prejudice appeared from California to New York. And for those Asians who know how to protect themselves from being infected and know how to reduce the spread, they wear a mask, which made them more vulnerable to be attacked. Since many people just regarded an asian with a mask as the virus carrier. <br><br>
But I just find it hilarious that people in asian countries, who are first exposed to the COVID, who had a much worse pandemic situation, get back to almost normal now, while in the US, the number are still increasing dramatically. Every one wore a mask and had a quarantine in Asian countries. While in America, with Trump blaming China for everything and calling it the Chinese virus again and again, the masks are not recommended until the very late.<br><br>
So here I made this camera that no matter whom use it, it will put a changeable mask on the face. And after changing mask styles for few times, user can also trigger the scenario of being beaten up like the Singaporean student I mention above. <br><br>
Hope it could emphasize the importance of wearing a mask during the COVID pandemic and reveal one aspect of Asian discrimination.<br><br>

America’s long history of scapegoating its Asian citizens<br>

When leaders call COVID-19 the “China virus,” it harkens back to decades of state-sanctioned discrimination against Asian Americans.<br><br>

As an Asian-American, I’ve been conditioned to a certain kind of unspoken racism. This pandemic has unmasked how vicious it really is.<br><br>

On one occasion when she wore a mask outside her office she was accosted by a woman. "She started yelling, 'Are you crazy? Get the heck out of here," said Ms Yu, 34. "I realised it was because I was wearing a mask."<br><br>

        A lot of fun in redesigning this monster! <br /><br />
        First, I got the upper body from Nishra’s drawing and the lower body
        from Yumeng’s. I tried to integrate the 2 parts with my monster’s head
        in Photoshop and it’s shown below.<br />
        <iframe
          width="720px"
          height="1296px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/fbc2a06c-a0ad-427a-ae11-00252e4e8f39%2FExquisite%20Corpse.jpg?v=1601390142707"
        >
        </iframe>
        Next, I thought about how to unify the style so that the 3 parts looks
        harmonious. I tried to use curves but the filled colors are rather too
        simple or complicated. Therefore, I found a intermediate way that is to
        use the triangles to divide the character and create the low-poly
        style.<br />
        <iframe
          width="400px"
          height="600px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/fbc2a06c-a0ad-427a-ae11-00252e4e8f39%2F1.svg?v=1601389878018"

        </iframe>
        Adobe Illustrator was used to set the triangles and the shapes as shown
        above. Then, I declared every triangle’s position and color in p5.js
        manually that requires a great deal of patience. After finishing all the
        still part of the character, I attempted to add some motion. Finally,
        with stars moving in the background, the monster could move the eyes
        with the mouse, so it is with the flower pattern. The lower “plate” also
        giggles like a seesaw. (But actually it ends up rotating
        counterclockwise if you let it move. XD) One more thing, press the mouse
        and the monster spew up a rainbow. It doesn’t mean anything, but it
        brings a spark of fun.<br /><br />

        New story
      </h1>

      <p>
        It’s a monster.<br />
        It’s a lonely monster.<br />
        It’s a lonely monster traveling across the universe.<br />
        It has a terrifying appearance and the ability to destroy a planet.
        <br />
        It leaps millions of light year but couldn’t meet a single creature.<br />
        It is filled with power that cannot be shown to the outside world.
        <br />
        It feels nothing but lonely.<br />
        All it can do is to spew up a rainbow.<br />
        It is controlled in a micro universe.<br />
        It can never escape. <br />

      <p>
        The exquisite corpse brings a lot of fun and surprises. Before, drawing
        is a process of visualizing the image in the mind on a canvas. But this
        being is a total mystery until you finish the puzzle at the end. Unlike
        the computer generated random pattern, each piece of it is a part of the
        creation of a real person. It introduces stories, thoughts, as well as
        reflections, which make the surreal narrative.
