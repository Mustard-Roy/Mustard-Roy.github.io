        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        When I was in primary school, my parents bought me a multi-function pen box. I like this pen box very much because it has many compartments and functions, which is different from the ordinary pen bag with only one opening. The pen case is blue and it has two layers. Open the lid of the top layer. There are two compartments on the top left for my eraser and pencil sharpener, and two large compartments on the right for my pens. The bottom layer is a drawer that pops up with just a click. I often used it to store little CARDS with little red stars that teachers gave me for my good performance. However, on the day of graduation,  I found that my pen box was missing when I got home. I was very sad that day because I lost all my CARDS.

      <p>
        The description written by my partner Ziyan is concise. After a quick reading, I could imagine the 2-layer blue pen box with a delicate drawer in my head. The little cards with red star that was stored in the drawer really reminds me of my primary school time and I feel the empathy of sadness when losing the cards. However, the structure of the top layer is a little bit fuzzy, with unclear descriptions of the top left compartmentsâ€”whether they lie in rows or in columns.
