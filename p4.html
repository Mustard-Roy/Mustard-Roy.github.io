        <b>Background Story 1 by Haoshu:</b><br><br>
Monster<br><br>
It’s a monster. It terrifies us. It makes our life aberrant. It could be Thanos with his ambition of eliminating half of the life in the universe. It could be a catastrophe causing millions of tragedies. It could also be the COVID-19 that changes our everyday patterns, hurts people and ruins families. <br><br>
But it is not a portrait of a fierce evil who plays with human life. It is a monster but it is not inevitable. It scares us at the beginning. But after people’s rebounding together with careful researches and works day and night, the monster could just be like what I draw on the canvas—a controlled plush object. <br><br>
      
        <b>Background Story 2 by Nishra:</b><br><br>
Meet Anonymous!<br><br>
They are everyone! They are you and I at some point in our lives!  They are battling for the well being of their mental health. They have anxiety that knots up their mind and ties up their gut; and depression that makes them weak in their knees. They are afraid to face the world that is often too harsh. They are fading from within trying to fit in. They’re Anonymous, because some do not want too recognize them. They’re resting waiting to get back up.<br><br>
        
        <b>Background Story 3 by Yumeng:</b><br><br>
I get the inspiration from my favorite book, the Little Prince. He is not in that story, and he comes from my imagination.<br><br>
Each person is composed of abstract geometric figures in that space, and each person is an independent and unique individual. They have their planet. Just as each of us is unique in reality, the communication between people is like the exploration between stars.<br><br>
I created this character because I believe that people should respect others' uniqueness while remaining themselves.<br><br>
