      <h1>
        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This is an iteration of the former project Experimental Camera by adding
        consentful interface. The design of interface follows the
        <a
          href="https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          >F.R.I.E.S</a
        >
        model. The main purpose of this interface is to let users understand
        that this page never gains any user data and totally respects user
        privacy. Consequently, they will feel free to allow the page when it
        acquires camera access. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        The original version of the Experimental Camera only has the Loading
        Page and Main Page. The former runs immediately when the page is open
        and asks for camera access without informing the user in advance. The
        later has only one button changing the masks in default style and cannot
        close the camera when using. It doesn’t follow the F.R.I.E.S model at
        all. <br /><br />
        Therefore, I build an additional Agree Page before asking the camera
        access and an About Page to introduce this program and the privacy rule.
        Also, several buttons in more delicate styles are added to the Main Page
        to trigger functions including “About”, “Restart” and “Reload”. The
        flowchart and sketches are shown below.<br /><br />
        <iframe
          width="1162px"
          height="892px"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/fbc2a06c-a0ad-427a-ae11-00252e4e8f39%2Fp6%20draft.jpeg?v=1603292482445"
        >
        </iframe>
        From the code level, the video is captured once the Agree button is
        clicked in the Agree Page. Thus, it won’t ask for camera access at the
        beginning. Button styles are set by different classes in “style.css” and
        respond when mouse hovering and clicking.<br /><br />
      </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Through this design, I have learned more characteristics and functions
        in p5.js like pixel array, createCapture from camera video,
        createGraphics to customize a vector graph whose alpha channel is used
        to mask another element by function mask, and import the clmtrackr.js to
        track the user’s face. There were lots of trials and errors and I came
        up with some tricky ways to solve the unexpected problems, for example,
        I found out when loading the video pixels, all of them are loaded to the
        canvas and cannot be masked, which could be solved by changing alpha
        values of the unneeded pixels into 0. It is necessary to understand how
        program “seeing” us from camera by loading the pixels with R, G, B and
        alpha value.<br /><br />
