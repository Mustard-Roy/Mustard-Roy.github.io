      <h1>
        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This is an iteration of the former project Experimental Camera by adding
        consentful interface. The design of interface follows the
        <a
          href="https://www.andalsotoo.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Building-Consentful-Tech-Zine-SPREADS.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          >F.R.I.E.S</a
        >
        model. The main purpose of this interface is to let users understand
        that this page never gains any user data and totally respects user
        privacy. Consequently, they will feel free to allow the page when it
        acquires camera access. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        The original version of the Experimental Camera only has the Loading
        Page and Main Page. The former runs immediately when the page is open
        and asks for camera access without informing the user in advance. The
        later has only one button changing the masks in default style and cannot
        close the camera when using. It doesn’t follow the F.R.I.E.S model at
        all. <br /><br />
        Therefore, I build an additional Agree Page before asking the camera
        access and an About Page to introduce this program and the privacy rule.
        Also, several buttons in more delicate styles are added to the Main Page
        to trigger functions including “About”, “Restart” and “Reload”. The
        flowchart and sketches are shown below.<br /><br />
        <p>
          <image src="https://cdn.glitch.com/fbc2a06c-a0ad-427a-ae11-00252e4e8f39%2FConcentful%20Cameara%20Flowchart.png?v=1605684696672"></image>
      </p>From the code level, the video is captured once the Agree button is
        clicked in the Agree Page. Thus, it won’t ask for camera access at the
        beginning. Button styles are set by different classes in “style.css” and
        respond when mouse hovering and clicking.<br /><br />
      </p>
      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        TIn terms of the F.R.I.E.S model, the Agree Page follows the rule of
        Informed and Specific by telling user how this page works, how their
        camera data is processed and their privacy is respected honestly. Users
        get to know that this page is about a video effect so that they can
        click the “Agree and Continue” button freely and enthusiastically.
        Meanwhile, when showing the camera effect, users can reload the page to
        stop showing it and close the camera, or simply close the page manually,
        which defers to the rule of Reversible. <br /><br />
        User’s experience of this program is recontextualized by the consentful
        interface comparing with the original version. They won’t feel ‘panic’
        anymore when it asks camera access. People know what it is at the
        beginning and they are aware of the their rights of leave at any time.
        Therefore, when these rights are guaranteed, user’s are more likely to
        immerse themself in this program. <br /><br />
