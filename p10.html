        Description and Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        Every year, Apple’s fall event catches attention of millions of people
        across the world. The newly released products become hot topics of the
        tech media coverage as well as the next-year gossip. Whether people talk
        about the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch or else, the new features, the
        more powerful capabilities and the controversial looks always lead to
        Apple with the word printed on every product’s packing box— ‘Designed by
        Apple in California’. <br /><br />
        Apart from Apple in California, people discuss less about the other
        manufacturing companies behind the product or think about where the
        manufactures and assemblers are located. “Made in China!”, some may say
        without a hesitation. But is it true? As Fred P. Hochberg writes in the
        article “The iPhone Isn’t Made in China—It’s Made Everywhere”—“American
        audio chips, Korean batteries, Congolese minerals, Japanese cameras,
        German accelerometers: The iPhone may well be the most truly global
        product yet.” [1] Hence, I decide to make an animated visualization
        showing the Apple suppliers across the world. <br /><br />
        I mainly refer to the Principle 7: Make Data Visible [2] from Data
        Feminism in designing the visualization. A world map is a good container
        to show all the suppliers equally across the world and make their labor
        visible. Below are the three initial concepts of this map. The first one
        is the animation that shows every company and its name one by one on the
        map. The second one shows all the suppliers on the map and highlights
        the mouse pointing ones with their names. The third one categorize the
        suppliers according to mouse pointing countries instead of the locations
        considering about the low accuracy of the mouse to the overlapping
        locations in the global map. Finally, I decide to combine the first and
        the second draft with special process to solve the mouse low precision
        problem. <br />
        <image

        ></image>
        The supplier list and retail store list come from Apple.com [3]. The
        names and the addresses of the top 200 suppliers for fiscal year 2018
        are listed in a PDF file and the addresses of all the Apple retail
        stores can be searched in the website. Next, I manage to transfer the
        data from PDF to an Excel file. Then, the latitude and longitude of each
        location are got from Map services and api, including Google Map
        Geocoding API [4] and Baidu Map LBS API [5]. Then, the names, countries
        and longitudes and latitudes are stored in a CSV file and loaded by
        p5.js to complete the animation and data visualization. The base map is
        provided by Mapbox with Mapbox static images API [6]. Last, I edit the
        speeches of previous Apple events and the music, WWW Is A Thing by DJ
        Quads, as the back ground music to enhance the experience. <br /><br />

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        From Apple’s supplier list PDF file, we see a 33-page table of 812
        locations of the top 200 suppliers in alphabetical order. With a quick
        glance, we may only notice the huge amount of factories in China, Japan,
        and United States, ignoring the others. Therefore, to better make all
        the suppliers’ effort visible, I use red circle to highlight their
        locations so that the solitary companies are revealed, say,
        STMicroelectronics N.V.’s branch in Malta that locates at the center of
        Mediterranean.<br /><br />
        So, I hope this map could give people a more comprehensive understanding
        of how the daily smartphones on their hands are manufactured. Instead of
        saying that an iPhone is designed from Apple in California and made in
        China, it is the product comes from the global efforts, from the people
        in different races and different places.
