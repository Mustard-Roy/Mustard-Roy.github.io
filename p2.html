        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
      In this design, we are acting as a conductor to let the computer generate a parameterized random pattern. A name of a book, The Beauty of Geometry, struck me and I drew a flash inspiration of the elegant polygons and circles that form the pattern of stars.<br><br>
I pictured colorful stars with changing sizes and points, some were thin and some were thick, suddenly clustering and dancing together. Then a trunk grew and as if hanging all the stars on the tree.<br><br>
I made a quick drawing, determined the elliptical boundary of the STAR TREE, and began visualize it by codes.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/fbc2a06c-a0ad-427a-ae11-00252e4e8f39%2Flab2draft.jpg?v=1600071056811"><br>
</p>
      <p>
* A star is generated by random parameters of the radiuses of the outer circle and inner circle as well as the number of points. The color of it is determined by the random RGB values.<br><br>
* Stars coordinates are created randomly and only the ones that locate inside the ellipse are captured. Each star is linked by a branch and become a part of the star net.<br><br>
* The color of the background along with trunk and branches is determined by the real-time mouse position. <br><br>
* When mouse is pressed, the star net starts changing and dancing.<br><br>
* When mouse is released, a random trunk grows.<br><br>
* The elegant and unique STAR TREE is present in front of you with a short sentence of congrats. If the trunk started at the left side of the bottom edge, the sentence should be at the right corner and vice versa.<br><br>
* You could always regenerate a new STAR TREE, but every time it’s different. And the number of attempts is shown at the up-left corner. <br><br>

        Reflection

      <p>
        The description written by my partner Ziyan is concise. After a quick reading, I could imagine the 2-layer blue pen box with a delicate drawer in my head. The little cards with red star that was stored in the drawer really reminds me of my primary school time and I feel the empathy of sadness when losing the cards. However, the structure of the top layer is a little bit fuzzy, with unclear descriptions of the top left compartments—whether they lie in rows or in columns.<br>
        In accomplishing this assignment,  I found out a big difference between drawing with codes and drawing with hands. I need to think in the logic of programming, for example, using coordinates to indicate the positions, shifting anchor points, and the later the figure is drawn, the higher the layer is.
