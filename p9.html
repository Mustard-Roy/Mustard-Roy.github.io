        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Laughter, one of the most common actions in our whole life, starts from
        the giggles when we are infants. It reveals the vividness in our normal
        life—the happy time, the leisure time, the grateful time, the releasing
        time, etc. Some of them blend into our memories and whenever we recall,
        they bring us to the similar moment. Yet, the others fade away.
        Therefore, I decided to document such moments and hope to find some
        unexpected pattern. <br /><br />
        This work demonstrates the seconds of me laughing in 7 days from
        November 23 to November 29. The cyan half of the canvas indicates the
        day from 6:00 to 18:00 and the dark blue half indicates the night. 7
        days of data scatters on the 7 concentric circles sequentially, where
        seconds in the day being illustrated as sun and those at night being
        illustrated as moon. If a moment is laughing together with friends, a
        halo is behind the icon. What’s more, if the content of making me
        laughing is conducted offline, in other world, I laugh because of things
        surrounding me in reality rather than those on the internet, the icon is
        connected to the center of the circles.
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        After deciding to to visualize my laughing moments, I stared my
        ‘documentary’ 7 days. At the beginning, I was not used to writing down
        the time, the content and the level of laughter when I laughed. It was
        after hours that I remembered the task and recorded the approximate
        time. Later, I gradually formed a habit of recording the moments. Most
        of the documentations are recorded in real time, except for the 6th
        day’s midnight when we had an all-night party, played games and laughter
        never stopped, I threw myself into the party and added the moments the
        next day, with randomized level of laughter in the step of 10 minutes in
        different game time intervals.<br /><br />
        Below is the data sheet. To protect the privacy of my friends and me,
        the detailed content that made me laugh are not shown, instead, I
        categorize them into Online/Offline, Alone/Together.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        In computer graphics, images and patterns are all parameterized and
        could be generated from mathematics. <br /><br />
        The forms of stars are protean due to the infinite values of outer and
        inner circle radiuses even in a limited range. The larger the difference
        of the radiuses is, the thinner the star point is. And with the
        increasing number of points, the star are more like a circle. Therefore,
        the point number is limited in a range of 3 to 8 for better illustration
        on this 400px*400px canvas.<br /><br />
        The pattern of the trunk is also unpredictable, with
        10px-vertical-length lines in increasing thickness joint together. Every
        line ends at the random position shifting 10px left or right
        horizontally. The extreme situation comes when every line is towards the
        same direction but the probability is less than
        1/1000000000000000000000000000. Hence, almost all the time, we could see
        an arbitrary winding trunk.
